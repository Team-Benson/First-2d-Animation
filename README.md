# 2D Ball Rolling Animation

This project demonstrates a **simple 2D ball rolling animation**, created for learning, demonstration, and reuse purposes.  
The animation focuses on basic motion principles such as rotation, translation, and timing.


Project Overview

The goal of this project is to visually represent how a ball rolls across a flat surface in 2D space.  
The animation can be used as:
- A learning reference for beginners
- A placeholder animation in games or UI prototypes
- A base animation for further stylization

Tools Used

- Blender (2D / Grease Pencil or 2D workflow)
- Optional vector or raster tools (SVG / PNG)
- Git for version control

Animation Concept

The animation follows these principles:

- Linear movement of the ball from left to right
- Consistent rotational motion synchronized with distance traveled
- Simple easing to avoid unnatural motion
- Minimal design to keep the animation reusable

The rolling effect is achieved by matching the rotation angle of the ball to its horizontal displacement.
